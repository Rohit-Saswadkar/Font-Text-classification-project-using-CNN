# Font Recognition Model and System
This model is trained upon my laptop due to Google drive upload time constraints for 1 GB dataset
This is Pycharm notebook file of the model for local run purpose - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1d5S1WG

This repository contains code for a Font Recognition Model and System built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The system is divided into two parts:

1. Model Development: This part involves building the font recognition model using CNN.

2. Font Recognition system: This part consists of building a Font detection system which detects text and recognizes the font of the input image.

## Steps to Use the Models

1. Download the "Font Dataset Large Model H5 file", which is the trained model file, and save it in Google Drive.

2. Paste the model link into the "Font Recognition system" notebook's model path section.

3. Paste any image link into the "Font Recognition system" notebook's image path section.

4. Run all cells in the notebook.

## Output

The system will display the image with the detected text using regions and the predicted font of each image.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or suggestions!
