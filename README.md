I divide our project into 2 as
1] Model development - 
    Built the font recognition model using CNN
2] Font Detection using model - 
    Built a Font detection system which will detect text and recognizes font of input image.

Steps to use the models
1] Download "Font Dataset Large Model H5 file" which is the Trained model file and save itin Google drive
2] Paste that model link into "Font Detection using model" model path
3] Paste any image link into "Font Detection using model" image path
4] Run all cells

Output- 
The system shows thee image with text detected using regions and predicted font of each image
